When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   A remote repository is ideal for projects that require collaboration.  It can also be helpful when work is beign done from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might have some changes that you are not ready to share with others/the public. There might also have been changes made to GitHub that could be undone by changes pulled from a remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A clone is making a copy of a repository either on git hub or locally. A fork can only be done on github to copy one member's repository to another person's while still providing a link to the original. Branches can be used on git hub or locally can be used to track different sets of changes made to a project while keeping the versions separate.
Clones would be used any time you need to make a copy of a repository, maybe onto a new computer.  A fork would be used to copy someone else's work (while giving them credit) so you can make changes to the files without impacting the originals.  Branches might be used to create different versions of a project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit of the having the last known state of the remote stored locally is so that even if you are working offline you can compare your work to the most recent state of the remote.
